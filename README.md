## Backdoor v4

Killing off bad servers made easy

Add your own code wherever you want and then
obfuscate it with [proguard](https://www.guardsquare.com/en/products/proguard) or
[Superblaubeere27's obfuscator](https://github.com/superblaubeere27/obfuscator)  
Superblaudbeere's one is really good but it doesn't rename public fields or methods so you can run them both but proguard is harder to config.  
Obfuscation is not required, it just makes it harder for the victim
to realize that their server is being backdoored.  
Remember to set debug to false in Main.java so onoy the players defined in Command.java can use the backdoor.

In the future there will probably be a feature to add users from the discord bot.
